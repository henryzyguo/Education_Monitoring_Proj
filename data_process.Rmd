## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read data}
enr_age <- read.csv('enr_by_agegrd.csv')
staff_ed <- read.csv('staff_by_ed.csv')
ent_new <- read.csv('new_entrants.csv')
schage_pop <- read.csv('schage_population.csv')
staff_qf <- read.csv('staff_by_qlf.csv')
stu_grd9 <- read.csv('Grd_0910Students.csv')
acad_grd9 <- read.csv('Grd_0910Academics.csv')
acad_12 <- read.csv("Grd1112_Academics.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
